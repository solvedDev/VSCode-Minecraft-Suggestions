# Outdated
This pack is outdated. If you're looking for up to date auto-completions for Minecraft add-ons, feel free to take a look at the dedicated add-on editor [bridge.](https://github.com/solveddev/bridge./)

# VSCode-Minecraft-Suggestions
Autocompletions for Minecraft's entity JSON. The descriptions and components were extracted from the official addon documentation. You shouldn't completely rely on the autocompletions but most are working quite well.

## Usage

#### Auto-complete components: 
Only type the name of the component, not the "minecraft:" prefix. After selecting the component, navigate with *tab* through the arguments.
#### Auto-complete filters: 
Only type the name of the filter, e.g. "in_water". After selecting the filter, use *tab* to navigate through the arguments. Use the *arrow keys* (up & down) to select a value for the argument. You can also type the value to search for it in the list -even though it might look strange in the file at first, it'll fix itself after confirming your selection with *tab*/*enter*.

## Installation for VSCode
1. Download this repository
2. Navigate to the VSCode extensions folder (%USERPROFILE% \ .vscode \ extensions)
